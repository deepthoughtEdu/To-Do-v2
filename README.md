# ToDo-List-v2

Before building the project first do npm install,
to install all the node module packages from the dependencies of package.json


## Problems in the Application

1. While updating a todo-item, we are getting an error. Can you have a look and fix it?
2. After fixing the UPDATE method, also do implement a success message that is sent from the server and gets rendered in the browser.
3. The DELETE call seems to work fine, but it is not deleting the entry from the database. Can you fix that too?
